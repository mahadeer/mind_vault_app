## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/mind_vault.git](https://github.com/your-username/mind_vault.git)
    cd mind_vault
    ```

2.  **Build the Project:**
    Navigate to the `mind_vault` directory and build the project.
    ```bash
    cargo build --release
    ```
    This will create an optimized executable in the `target/release/` directory.

### Running MindVault

Since MindVault is a monolithic application, you'll run it directly from your terminal.

```bash
./target/release/mind_vault
```

## Usage

MindVault is designed to be launched and managed by external tools or workflows that are configured to interact with "MCP servers." It provides a powerful command-line interface for managing your personal notes and generating LLM-ready JSON data.

### Integration with External Tools

If your external tool expects a configuration to launch and interact with an MCP server, you can configure it to run MindVault as follows:

JSON

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mindvault-local": {
      "command": "./target/release/mind_vault",
    }
  }
}

```

_(**Note:** The `serve` argument and `--config` flag are placeholders. You would implement these within MindVault to handle such an integration, allowing it to start in a mode that processes commands or serves data as required by the external tool. The specific commands for adding notes or exporting data would then be invoked via the `args` array or through subsequent interactions with the launched `mind_vault` process.)_

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through setting up and running MindVault on your local machine.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mahadeer/mind_vault_app.git
    cd mind_vault_app
    ```

2.  **Build the Project:**
    Navigate to the `mind_vault_app` directory and build the projects.

    ```bash
    cargo build --release --package mindvault-mcp
    ```

    This will create optimized executables for `mindvault-tool` in their respective `target/release/` directories.

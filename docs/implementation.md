# Implementation Progress

### Step-by-Step Plan

#### 1. `mindvault-api`
- [x] Set up Axum project with MongoDB integration.
- [x] Define `Task` model with JSON (de)serialization and soft delete support.
- [x] Implement comprehensive task management routes:
    - `GET /tasks` → get all non-deleted tasks
    - `GET /tasks/{id}` → get specific task by ID
    - `POST /tasks` → create single task
    - `PUT /tasks/{id}` → update task (status, priority, due_date only)
    - `DELETE /tasks/{id}` → soft delete task
    - `POST /tasks/bulk` → bulk create multiple tasks
    - `DELETE /tasks/status/{status}` → bulk soft delete by status
    - `GET /tasks/search` → search tasks with filters (text, status, priority, due_date)
    - `PUT /tasks/search` → search and update matching tasks
- [x] Add comprehensive input validation and error handling
- [x] Implement soft delete functionality with proper filtering
- [x] Add auto-increment ID generation for efficient bulk operations
- [ ] Define `Comment` model with JSON (de)serialization.
- [ ] Implement comment routes:
    - `POST /comments` → add comment
    - `GET /comments` → query by `person_name`, date range, or keyword
- [ ] Containerize with Docker (optional for deployability)

#### 2. `mindvault-tool`
- [ ] Set up Rust project and add `rust-mcp` SDK
- [ ] Define tool: `summarize_performance(name: String, time_range: String)`
- [ ] Call API with extracted name/time
- [ ] Receive and format comment history
- [ ] Return markdown-style summary input back to Claude

#### 3. `mindvault-ui`
- [ ] Set up Dixous project
- [ ] Build pages:
    - Comment input form
    - Person history viewer with filters (time, keyword)
- [ ] Connect to `mindvault-api`
- [ ] Optional: Integrate with Claude to show summaries in browser

#### 4. Shared Library (`mindvault-shared`)
- [x] Define `Task` struct with shared types and enums
- [x] Define DTOs for task operations:
    - `CreateTaskRequest` - for single task creation
    - `BulkCreateTaskRequest` - for bulk task creation
    - `UpdateTaskRequest` - for partial task updates
    - `SearchAndUpdateRequest` - for search and update operations
    - `TaskSearchParams` - for search filtering
- [x] Define task enums: `ETaskStatus`, `ETaskPriority`
- [x] Utility helpers for date formatting and validation
- [ ] Define `Comment` struct with shared types
- [ ] Utility helpers for comment formatting, validation

#### 5. Task Management System (Implemented)
- [x] **Core CRUD Operations**
    - Create, Read, Update, Delete tasks with proper validation
    - Soft delete implementation (records marked as deleted, not physically removed)
    - Partial updates (only status, priority, due_date can be modified)
    - Protected fields (name, created_at, id cannot be updated)

- [x] **Bulk Operations**
    - Bulk create multiple tasks in single request
    - Bulk soft delete by status
    - Efficient ID generation for bulk operations
    - Atomic operations with proper error handling

- [x] **Advanced Search & Filtering**
    - Text search in task names
    - Filter by status, priority, due date
    - Complex multi-criteria searches
    - Search and update in single operation

- [x] **Data Integrity & Validation**
    - Comprehensive input validation
    - Consistent soft delete filtering across all queries
    - Auto-increment ID generation with centralized management
    - Proper error handling with descriptive messages

- [x] **API Testing & Documentation**
    - Complete Postman collection with automated tests
    - Comprehensive API documentation
    - Test scripts for all CRUD scenarios
    - Environment variables for easy testing

## Gathering Results

To evaluate the success and effectiveness of MindVault, the following criteria will be tracked post-deployment:

### Functionality Validation

#### Task Management System (Completed)
- [x] Tasks can be created, read, updated, and soft deleted successfully.
- [x] Bulk operations work efficiently for multiple tasks.
- [x] Search and filtering return accurate results based on criteria.
- [x] Soft delete properly hides deleted tasks from all queries.
- [x] Input validation prevents invalid data entry.
- [x] Error handling provides clear, actionable error messages.
- [x] API endpoints follow RESTful conventions and return proper status codes.
- [x] Postman collection provides comprehensive testing coverage.

#### Comment System (Pending)
- [ ] Comments can be added and retrieved with accurate filters.
- [ ] Claude or LM Studio correctly receives and interprets tool outputs.
- [ ] Summaries generated reflect meaningful aggregation of comments.

### Usability Metrics
- [ ] Time taken by leads to add or retrieve feedback is low.
- [ ] Feedback coverage across all team members is consistent.
- [ ] Frontend and tool interaction is seamless and intuitive.

### System Performance

#### Task Management System
- [x] MongoDB query performance optimized with proper filtering.
- [x] Bulk operations use efficient `insert_many` and `update_many` operations.
- [x] Auto-increment ID generation minimizes database round trips.
- [x] Soft delete queries properly indexed with compound filters.
- [x] API response times consistently under 1000ms (validated in Postman tests).
- [x] Search operations handle complex multi-criteria filtering efficiently.

#### Overall System
- [ ] MongoDB query performance under expected load (filtering large comment sets).
- [ ] API uptime and latency benchmarks.
- [ ] Tool latency (Claude ↔ API ↔ DB) for summary generation.

### LLM Feedback Quality (Qualitative)
- [ ] Lead satisfaction with generated summaries.
- [ ] Degree to which summaries help in performance reviews or retros.

### Future Enhancements

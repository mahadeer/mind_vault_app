- **Priority Assignment**: Mark critical path items as high priority
- **Resource Allocation**: Consider team capacity and skills

## Advanced LLM Integration Patterns

### Context-Aware Task Management

#### Pattern 1: Intelligent Task Prioritization
**User Input:** "I have a deadline tomorrow and three high priority tasks. Help me prioritize."

**LLM Process:**
1. Fetch all high priority tasks
2. Analyze due dates and dependencies
3. Provide prioritized recommendations
4. Offer to update task priorities automatically

#### Pattern 2: Proactive Task Suggestions
**User Input:** "I just completed the authentication module."

**LLM Process:**
1. Mark authentication task as completed
2. Search for related/dependent tasks
3. Suggest next logical tasks
4. Offer to create follow-up tasks

#### Pattern 3: Smart Bulk Operations
**User Input:** "Clean up my completed tasks from last month."

**LLM Process:**
1. Search for completed tasks from specified timeframe
2. Present summary for confirmation
3. Perform bulk delete operation
4. Provide cleanup summary

### Error Handling and Recovery

#### Graceful Error Responses
**Scenario:** Task creation fails due to validation error

**LLM Response:**
"I couldn't create the task because the name field is required. Let me help you fix this. What would you like to name this task?"

#### Smart Retry Logic
**Scenario:** Network timeout during bulk operation

**LLM Response:**
"The bulk operation timed out. I was able to create 3 out of 5 tasks successfully. Would you like me to retry creating the remaining 2 tasks?"

### Integration with External Systems

#### Calendar Integration
**User Input:** "Create tasks for all my meetings this week."

**LLM Process:**
1. Fetch calendar events
2. Convert meetings to preparation/follow-up tasks
3. Set appropriate due dates and priorities
4. Create tasks with meeting context

#### Email Integration
**User Input:** "Create tasks from my unread emails marked as important."

**LLM Process:**
1. Scan important unread emails
2. Extract actionable items
3. Create tasks with email context
4. Link tasks back to original emails
